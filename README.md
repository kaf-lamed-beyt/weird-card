# weird-card-transitions

I've always disliked the concept of positioning in CSS because it felt too far-fetched to me, and because i was too lazy to sit with it. I struggled so much to grasp the concept behind it.

Now, that i am getting close to understanding it a bit. I tried making this card that leverages on positioning, simple transitions and a keyframe.

## why?

Why not?

## LICENSE?

Feel free to whatever you want with it.
